A agenda da chamada cooperação sul-sul também era prioritária para o Brasil naquela época, mas houve bastante desconfiança do governo brasileiro em relação à pesquisa porque era liderada pelos britânicos e financiada pelo seu governo.","A colaboração começou com a participação das equipes dos BRICS na elaboração da metodologia da pesquisa. Posteriormente cada país seguiu com a sua própria investigação. No caso do Brasil a pesquisa envolveu levantamento de bibliografia, entrevistas, grupos focais, oficina de validação.","We mutually decided on it","Nosso maior problema foi em mostrar para o governo brasileiro que nossa pesquisa era motivada por uma agenda própria, que convergiam com a agenda de pesquisa do IDS. Também pude perceber que algumas de nossas descobertas não foram bem vistas pelos britânicos, principalmente quando mostramos como os interesses de outros países e organizações influenciavam a agenda da ajuda brasileira para os países mais pobres. Pareciam estar interessados mais nas críticas à ajuda brasileira, pois o Brasil estava contribuindo para questionar o modelo tradicional da ajuda britânica. Ou seja, a pesquisa aconteceu em um contexto de disputas geopolíticas e o tipo de descoberta que foi aceita parecia estar vinculado a essas questões. Essa foi a minha impressão como líder da equipe brasileira.","Eu resolvi que o melhor caminho para ter reconhecimento científico das minhas pesquisas seria me vincular a uma universidade, em vez de trabalhar com pesquisa em uma organização da sociedade civil. Minha opção foi continuar no Brasil. No meio das disputas com o governo brasileiro em torno da neutralidade da pesquisa sofri algumas consequências em Brasília, que prefiro não detalhar, e nesse contexto o IDS me ofereceu um emprego. Mas eu também entendia por que o governo brasileiro estava desconfiado, pois como disse de fato nossas descobertas tinham implicações geopolíticas claras.","Yes","Methodology - Development or design of methodology; creation of models, Investigação - Conduzir um processo de pesquisa, por exemplo, realizar os experimentos, ou coleta de dados, Writing - Original draft","Yes",NA,"Em geral cada país do BRICS produziu as suas próprias próprias publicações. Mas no caso do relatório do Brasil pedimos contribuições da equipe britânica, então eles apareceram entre os autores, mas mantendo a ordem de autoria de acordo com o que cada um contribuiu de fato. Ou seja, como a contribuição britânica foi menor, ficaram listado por último. Eles também organizaram um livro comas contribuições, e chegaram a perguntar para os pesquisadores envolvidos se queriam ser editores também.","English, Portuguese","Yes","Acho que os britânicos se beneficiaram muito da contribuição da equipe do Brasil para a construção da metodologia geral do projeto. A equipe britânica parecia estar dedicada a muitas tarefas, e tinham pouco tempo para desenhar e executar o projeto. Nos estávamos apenas com esse projeto na época, e podíamos nos dedicar full time. Para o IDS, instituto de referência tradicional em ajuda externa, houve o ganho claro de se beneficiarem de descobertas sobre os doadores emergentes, e seguirem como referência na área, inclusive prospectando novas consultorias. O ganho para a equipe brasileira foi menos em termos de conhecimento e mais em termos de reconhecimento no Brasil e no exterior, o que posteriormente abriu diversas portas para captar recursos para outras pesquisas.","Financiamento, planejamento, prazos, comprometimento da equipe, necessidade clara de ambas as partes de realização da pesquisa, disponibilidade de tempo para sua priorização.","Depois de passar pela experiência que narrei aqui dei início a outro programa de pesquisa, já como profa da UFSC, que abrange pesquisas sobre a colaboração científica internacional. Mais informações em ricti.ufsc.br. Acredito que os pesquisadores que se envolvam em projetos internacionais precisam de algum tipo de capacitação para que possam entender que as colaborações não são movidas apenas pelo interesse dos pesquisadores, mas também por disputas e interesses dos estados de origem dos pesquisadores, sendo que os países mais desenvolvidos costumam ter uma vantagem clara nessas disputas. Principalmente, deve haver cuidado no compartilhamento de dados em áreas sensíveis, como dados relacionados à biodiversidade. Ao mesmo tempo, o que os outros países objetivam é justamente acessar esses dados, e nossos jovens talentos. Entender como navegar nesse mundo em que a cooperação é necessária, mas pode trazer ganhos extremamente desiguais, é fundamental para nós da América Latina.","Não sei como responder essa pergunta, pois as implicações éticas não aparecem na agenda. Ninguém diz que quem financia a colaboração pode estar pautado por uma lógica de competição com os países dos pesquisadores que são convidados a colaborar.","pt"
